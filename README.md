# Station Game thingy

Station Game Thingy is a space-station management game. It was inspired by
- Dwarf Fortress
- Alien[s,2,isolation]
- Cataclysm: DDA

## Development Decisions
Station Game Thingy is heavily inspired by the whole 1970s themes of green cursors, 
malevolent clicking, and ~~shi~~ bad programming.
